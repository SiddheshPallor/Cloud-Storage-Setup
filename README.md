This project shows how to create an S3 bucket, upload a file, and understand permission settings in AWS S3.

## What I Did
- Created an S3 bucket: `my-cloud-project-bucket1`
- Uploaded `netflix_titles.csv` using the AWS Console
- Tried to make the file public using ACL (but it was blocked)
- Learned how AWS handles public access and ACL restrictions

## Key Takeaways
- ACLs (Access Control Lists) are disabled by default for security
- Public access should be managed using Bucket Policies or IAM
- Hands-on experience with S3 object upload and permissions

## üì∏ Screenshots
Please refer to the Documentation file for supporting images.

## Common Issue Faced
- Could not enable public access via ACL due to AWS default settings
- Understood how to troubleshoot and apply best practices for object security

## Tools Used
- AWS S3
- AWS Console (Web GUI)
- Sample dataset: `netflix_titles.csv`
